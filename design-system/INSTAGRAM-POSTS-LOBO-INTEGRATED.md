(TOP-RIGHT, standard style)
```

**LOBO PRIME INTEGRATION:**
```
Variation: CIENTÍFICO (knowledge guide, mechanism explainer)
Dimensions: 120x120px (prominent learning guide)
Position: TOP of text section, centered on right half
Distance from top: 16px (above headline)
Horizontal: Centered in right section
Glow: 18px bright lime green halo (#BFFF00 @ 55% opacity)
Shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)
Expression: Wise, analytical, process-focused
DNA/Grid: Visible geometric patterns (scientific aesthetic)
Eyes: Intelligent, guiding (leads through process)
Opacity: 100%

Placement Logic:
- CIENTÍFICO Lobo = leads through mechanism
- Positioned above numbered steps = "I guide you through this"
- Large size = authority on science
- Process follows Lobo = "Follow this wolf through the science"
- Message: "The science is here, follow my guidance"
```

**Design Notes:**
- 5-step process should be easy to follow
- Numbers in lime green = visual hierarchy
- "7 dias" emphasis = answers speed objection
- Science feel = credibility builder
- Tone: "Here's how it actually works"
