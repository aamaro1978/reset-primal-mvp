# 🐺⚡ LOBO PRIME - LAUNCH MVP STRATEGY
**Single Logo for Fast Execution + Iteration Plan**

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC PIVOT

**Original Plan:** 5 Lobo variations (NEUTRO, INSPIRADO, CIENTÍFICO, TRANSFORMADOR, CELEBRACIÓN)
**MVP Strategy:** 1 Lobo for launch (NEUTRO) + 4 variants phase 2

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- ✅ NEUTRO already generated + validated
- ✅ Fastest path to launch (skip 4 AI generations)
- ✅ Perfect validator/guardian aesthetic (works everywhere)
- ✅ Consistent brand presence (same Lobo across all channels)
- ✅ Post-launch can add variety without blocking launch
- ✅ Simpler for designers (1 asset, not 5)
- ✅ FEB 7 ready vs FEB 8 with all 5

---

## 📋 MVP EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: LAUNCH (FEB 7) - With NEUTRO Only

**All 30 Instagram Posts:** Use NEUTRO in every post
```
Post 1 (Brain Fog): NEUTRO 80x80px bottom-right ✅
Post 2 (BDNF): NEUTRO 60x60px corner ✅
Post 3 (Before/After): NEUTRO 100x100px CENTER ← still powerful
Post 4 (Symptoms): NEUTRO 70x70px left side ✅
Post 5 (Missing Piece): NEUTRO 120x120px left ← validates science
...
Post 30 (Last Chance): NEUTRO 130x130px center ✅

Visual Impact: Consistent mascote presence, professional, grounded
```

**All 5 Email Sequences:** NEUTRO headers + signature
```
Sequence 1-5: NEUTRO 100x100px in headers
All signatures: NEUTRO 60x60px
Feeling: Calm authority, trust, consistency
```

**All 3 Video Thumbnails:** NEUTRO in each
```
Thumbnail 1 (Brain Fog): NEUTRO 200x200px center-left
Thumbnail 2 (Metabolism): NEUTRO 200x200px center
Thumbnail 3 (Results): NEUTRO 200x200px center-right
Consistent brand anchor across videos
```

**All 5 Instagram Stories:** NEUTRO placement
```
Story 1-5: NEUTRO 120-150px positioned strategically
Recurring brand element users see daily
```

**Timeline:**
```
FEB 7:
├─ 08:00 ✅ NEUTRO already generated
├─ 09:00-12:00 🏗️ Designer 1-3: 30 Instagram posts with NEUTRO (faster, single asset)
├─ 13:00-15:00 🏗️ Email templates with NEUTRO headers
├─ 15:00-17:00 🏗️ Video thumbnails with NEUTRO
└─ 17:00-20:00 🏗️ Stories templates with NEUTRO

FEB 8:
├─ 09:00-12:00 QA gates + quality checks
└─ 13:00-17:00 Final polish

FEB 9:
├─ 09:00-12:00 Fiscal Guardia validation
└─ 13:00-18:00 Ready for LIDER delivery
```

**Expected: ALL ASSETS READY FEB 9, LAUNCH FEB 11** ✅

---

### Phase 2: VARIANT EXPANSION (POST-LAUNCH)

**Timeline: FEB 12-14 (after launch stabilization)**

Once campaign is live and performing:

```
FEB 12:
├─ 08:00-12:00 Generate 4 remaining variants (Clipdrop, 15-20 min)
│  ├─ INSPIRADO (energy posts)
│  ├─ CIENTÍFICO (research posts)
│  ├─ TRANSFORMADOR (power posts)
│  └─ CELEBRACIÓN (victory posts)
└─ 13:00-17:00 Begin selective post updates

FEB 13-14:
├─ Update Series A top-performing posts with new variants
├─ Test variation impact on engagement
├─ Optimize Lobo placement per variant
└─ Document learnings for next campaigns
```

**What This Enables:**
- ✅ Faster launch (no waiting for 4 AI generations)
- ✅ Data-driven variant selection (use winners, retire losers)
- ✅ Continuous brand evolution (keeps social fresh)
- ✅ A/B test opportunities (same post with different Lobo = test)
- ✅ Post-campaign insights (which variant performs best?)

## 🎨 NEUTRO: THE UNIVERSAL VALIDATOR

**Why NEUTRO Works for Entire Launch:**

### Expression & Feeling
```
✓ Calm, knowing, protective
✓ Validates user's journey (problem → solution)
✓ Guardian energy (safe, trustworthy)
✓ Scientific credibility (geometric precision)
✓ Universal appeal (not too energetic, not too cold)
```

### Visual Consistency
```
✓ Geometric aesthetic consistent across posts
✓ Lime green glow (#BFFF00) signature element
✓ Dark green (#1B4D3E) grounding color
✓ Works on all backgrounds (white, gradient, image overlay)
✓ Scalable 32px-500px without loss
```

### Versatility Across Posts
```
Validation posts (Brain fog, symptoms): NEUTRO says "I see you" ✓
Educational posts (BDNF, science): NEUTRO says "I know this" ✓
Social proof posts (4,327 people): NEUTRO says "I validated this" ✓
Guarantee posts (Money back): NEUTRO says "I stand by this" ✓
CTA posts (Take action): NEUTRO says "You can trust this" ✓
```

**Result:** Single coherent brand voice, stronger unity, professional consistency
